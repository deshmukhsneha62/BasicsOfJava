## First Java Program

Note:  In Java, every application begins with a class name, and that class must match the filename.
1. Every program has a starting point
Here it is the main function

public static void main(String[] args)\
{\
// statements\
}

2. the main function is always written inside a class

class ClassName\
{\
public static void main(String[] args)\
{\
// statements\
}\
}\
Write a program to print “hello world”

class HelloWord\
{\
public static void main(String[] args)\
{\
System.out.println(“Hello World”);\
}\
}

Save the file using className.java (HelloWorld.java)
